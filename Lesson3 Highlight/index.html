            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems (VCS) are a lot cooler than they sound. Though they may seem like a weird form of boring database or a funny name for a VCR player, version control systems help web app developers, web designers (that I aspire to be), and many other people out in big ways. First of all, you can back up all of your versions of an app or a website by backing up all your files to a VCS. For instance: let’s say you make this really cool sketch of your best friend on adobe sketch, and you love the way it looks, but it absolutely needs more color! You start adding all kinds of crazy colors and make irreversible saves and deletions late at night, but wake up to totally regret ever moving past the sketch stage! Instead of pressing the “undo” button 5,000,000 times, just revert to an older version! How? Through a version control system, of course! It basically saves you from wearing out your mind and your finder by saving previous versions. It even lets you compare old and new versions of a file or an entire project so you can have a better perspective on things!</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git repositories are extremely useful to today’s web designers, web developers, and the like. Why? What even is a “repository”? Well, a repository is where you can store things such as data. Getting a git repository can mean either importing existing data into Git, or essentially copying data from one server and pasting it into Git. The former is more for inserting your own data into a repository as a backup, and the latter is more for people who want to take copies of  files or a directory and edit them, in turn creating a new version or versions of the data. In this specific case, I have copied files from the dropbox I have been directed to and I pasted them into my local git repository. All it takes to create a new repository is through a few commands starting with a ‘git init’ which copies the files, and a ‘git commit’ which opens up a subdirectory and gives you your initial commit. Repositories and being able to use versioning are very important to developers or designers because they allow for storage, backups, and much more.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands!</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are a multitude of git commands. It’s a lot like a separate language with certain key terms that are super helpful for saving time and getting stuff done. I’m going to go through just a handful of the basic commands with super basic explanations. To start, there’s ‘git init’, which starts it all off. Then there is ‘git commit’, which basically solidifies the changes you have made thus far. ‘Git status’ is a useful command because it lets you know what state (untracked, unmodified, modified, staged) certain files are in. However, sometimes the status of files can be really wordy and harder to sift through. In this case, you can run the command ‘git status -s’ (s for short) to get a much more concise version of the status. ‘Git add’ is a bit more versatile and can be used in a few different ways such as in tracking a new file, staging them, or overall just moving files to that important next stage before commitment. Now, I know this is a lot to take in (trust me) but learning these and many of the other commands will greatly benefit you in the long run by saving your time and making you more proficient at your work!</p>

                <span class="text-muted">3 Stepping Stones of VCS!</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three very important stepping stones that you can put files through. These stones are kind of like participating in higher education (such as attending FSU): you want to get them to the greater good - the end result. To do that, however, often involves taking steps forward, backward, and finally to the very end of all of your struggle and hard work. The first step is The git directory: where all of your data is stored in case anything little (or catastrophic) goes wrong. Arguably the most important stepping stone, it’s more like a home base or a metaphorical library for all of your data that you copied over for your project. From the git directory (aka the library), you can pull out files to edit them or just check on them on the next stepping stone, which is the working tree. From there, you can take the next big leap over to the last stepping stone, which is the staging area. Some people call it the ‘index’ instead of the staging area. Once files are in that coveted staging area are edited to absolute perfection, they can be committed back into the git directory where they are safe and sound until you feel like grabbing them out again.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local v Remote Repositories!</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Local repositories are the heart and soul of Git and are a main, commonly used resource for web developers and designers. Remote repositories are more like the backups of the heart and soul just in case disaster happens. The local repository is in a nearby server. The remote repository is located in a farther away, most likely centralized server shared by multiple members. This is super beneficial to all members who want to take files or directories from the remote repository and transfer them to a local repository. This transfer lets users essentially take a copy of a project and morph it into whatever they want -- all without affecting anyone else’s work! And, because they are using a version control system, they can easily undo major changes if they change their minds about what they’ve done. Or, if they’ve made the greatest mistake of all time and accidentally deleted the entire project, there could be a backup on the remote repository. I think having both a local and a remote repository is a great idea because it is really reassuring to have multiple versions as well as somewhere that has your back just in case.</p>
